# Project Data Template: Alabama Toxics Criteria Advocacy

## Project Overview
- **Slug**: alabama-toxics-criteria-advocacy
- **Name**: Alabama Toxics Criteria Advocacy
- **Status**: ACTIVE
- **Start Date**: 2026-01-01
- **Primary Owner Email**: corear@mobilebaykeeper.org
- **Short Description**: Reduce toxic pollution and improve fish consumption safety in the Mobile River watershed (Mobile, Baldwin, Clarke, Monroe, Washington counties) by exposing gaps in fish consumption advisories, identifying priority industrial dischargers (Dirty Dozen), and driving stronger standards and enforceable pollution limits (303(d) listings and TMDLs).
- **Badges**: Toxic pollution reduction, Fish consumption advisories, Dirty Dozen, TMDLs, Water quality standards

### Case for Change
- **Summary**: Communities in the Mobile Bay area who rely on or enjoy consuming locally caught finfish are at risk of long-term toxic exposure linked to permitted industrial pollution. ADPH has failed to report 3,471 fish consumption advisories (since 2010), spanning 32 species in 157 waterways across a variety of toxics, and appears to rely on less protective FDA action levels (except mercury) rather than EPA risk-based advisory thresholds. This failure reduces public awareness and also undermines the Clean Water Act pathway that should follow advisories: EPA recommends using advisory information to support 303(d) impairment listings, which can drive development of TMDLs that cap pollutant loading and translate into enforceable permit limits. In the Mobile Bay area, advisories are currently framed narrowly around mercury with “atmospheric deposition” cited as the impairment cause, even though there are permitted point sources that discharge mercury directly, affecting how waterbodies are diagnosed and how TMDLs are designed. Baykeeper’s technical foundation includes a “missing advisories” analysis (FTMP fish tissue composites compared to EPA advisory thresholds, reviewed with retired EPA FCA expertise) and a “Dirty Dozen” facility ranking built from toxic weighted load, compliance and impairment factors, and environmental justice indicators. The project will package these findings to (1) hold ADPH/ADEM accountable, (2) build public and influencer pressure, (3) train other Waterkeepers to replicate the approach statewide, and (4) identify priority toxics, waterways, and facilities for a political and regulatory campaign to improve criteria, advisory issuance, and TMDL implementation.

## Communications Plan
- **Comms Lead Email**: corear@mobilebaykeeper.org
- **Backup Lead Email**: 
- **Approval Required**: Yes
- **Approver Notes**: Approval required if content includes numbers or stats.
- **Local Narrative**: Subsistence fishermen often are not aware of fish consumption advisories. Those who are aware may ignore them. Recreational anglers know advisories exist, but there is confusion about what species and waterways are tested, what the state tests for, and whether it is only methylmercury or other toxics too.
- **Messaging Watchouts**: ADEM freezing us out. State and local leaders turning a blind eye due to industry pressure. Avoid messaging that reads as blanket “over-regulation.”
- **Risk & Minefields**: Getting public buy-in without scaring people away from fishing and seafood, especially subsistence fishermen. After meeting with ADEM’s TMDL team, no progress toward a statewide mercury TMDL, and mercury impairment is not a priority for them.
- **General Notes**: Current CTA is the petition comments sign-on. Public hearing is January 12, 2026 at 1:00 p.m., ADEM Central Office, 1400 Coliseum Blvd, Montgomery. Social post planned between 2026-01-01 and 2026-01-11.

### Key Messages
| Audience | Text | Priority |
|----------|------|----------|
| EXTERNAL | Alabama has proposed stronger toxics standards, but it is not final yet. Public support matters before the EMC vote. | 1 |
| EXTERNAL | Alabama is not providing clear, protective guidance on which fish are safe to eat, and toxics protections have been outdated. | 1 |
| EXTERNAL | Fishing is part of our way of life. We are using fish tissue and discharge data to reveal gaps in advisories and identify facilities discharging toxic pollutants. | 1 |
| EXTERNAL | Stronger advisories can trigger 303(d) listings and TMDLs that cap toxic pollution, directly limiting discharges from specific facilities. | 2 |
| EXTERNAL | We will use Baykeeper sampling and community visibility to keep agencies accountable and push for standards that are implemented and enforced. | 2 |

### FAQ
| Question | Answer | Priority |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Is ADEM’s proposed toxics rule final? | No. It has been proposed, and the EMC still must finalize it. Public support matters because there may be pressure to weaken or stall adoption. | 1 |
| What should I do right now? | Attend the January 12, 2026 public hearing in Montgomery if you can, and sign the petition if you cannot attend. | 1 |
| What is the Dirty Dozen? | A ranked list of priority facilities based on toxic weighted load, compliance and impairment factors, and environmental justice indicators, used to focus sampling, storytelling, and accountability. | 2 |
| Why are advisories tied to pollution reduction? | Advisory information can support 303(d) impairment listings, which can lead to TMDLs that cap pollution and translate into enforceable limits in permits. | 2 |
| How do you communicate risk without telling people to stop fishing? | Focus on clear, specific guidance and agency accountability, so people can make informed choices without panic, while the state is pushed to reduce pollution at the source. | 2 |
