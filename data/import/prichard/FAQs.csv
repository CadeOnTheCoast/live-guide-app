prichard-wastewater,There’s no money for this.,"Money is on the table. Alabama receives federal funds every year for sewer fixes. Prichard just needs to be put at the top of the list where the need is greatest.",1
prichard-wastewater,Why should people outside Prichard care about this?,"Sewage spills don’t stop at city lines. What happens in Prichard flows into Three Mile Creek, then into Mobile Bay. That affects fishing, swimming, and water quality for the whole region. Polluted water anywhere is a problem everywhere.",2
prichard-wastewater,Isn’t this just Prichard mismanaging their system?,"The system is decades old and hasn’t had the investment needed to keep up. This is about outdated infrastructure and lack of state/federal funding, not people failing their community. Residents deserve the same protections as any other city.",3
prichard-wastewater,Why can’t Prichard just pay for its own fixes?,"Sewer system overhauls cost millions. No city can tackle that alone, especially one with fewer resources. That’s why federal and state funding exists, to make sure every community has safe water and working infrastructure.",4
prichard-wastewater,Is there really funding available?,"Yes. Alabama gets tens of millions every year from the federal State Revolving Fund to fix sewer and water systems. Prichard qualifies as a disadvantaged community, which means some of the money could even be forgiven. The funding exists — it’s about prioritization.",5
prichard-wastewater,What’s being done to hold the utility accountable?,"We’re pushing for enforcement of permit limits so the utility can’t keep releasing sewage above safe levels. At the same time, we’re advocating for state and federal funds to fix the system so the spills stop for good.",6
prichard-wastewater,Isn’t this just a Prichard problem? Why call it regional?,"The spills reach waterways that connect across Mobile. It impacts fish, oysters, and recreation in the Bay. Protecting Prichard protects all of us — water moves, pollution spreads.",7
prichard-wastewater,Why focus on Prichard when other communities also have problems?,"Every community deserves attention, but the crisis is worst in Prichard. Residents there face 49 times more sewage pollution than neighboring cities. We have to start where the harm is greatest.",8
