prichard-wastewater,cdenson@mobilebaykeeper.org,wperry@mobilebaykeeper.org,TRUE,"Approval required from Charith Denson and Wade or William. Messaging about federal rules, SRF funding, and ADEM must be approved by legal because of accuracy and sensitivity.","Community members often describe living with sewage in their yards and streets. Residents stress fairness and want equal protection as neighboring cities. Sensitivity remains important. We avoid framing this as a community failure. The government has failed them. Three Mile Creek and Chickasaw Creek flow into the Mobile River and Mobile Bay. This hurts all of us. People want honesty, transparency, and a path forward that does not place blame on the community but recognizes the years of warning signs and inaction from leadership. Many say they feel forgotten, despite living in the heart of the watershed that connects straight to the Mobile River and the Bay. Their message is simple: protect us the same way you protect everyone else.","Evaulate comms to be sure we're not leading people to blame (or pity) Prichard residents. Do not frame as 'local mismanagement only' — emphasize systemic failure (government corruption and lack of care for people) + need for funding. Be careful not to oversimplify the issue as only a Prichard problem. Sewage from Prichard flows into Three Mile Creek, Chickasaw Creek, the Mobile River, and Mobile Bay. This affects all of Coastal Alabama. Avoid overstating the role of Baykeeper. We do not run the sewer system and we do not make funding decisions. We advocate, we analyze, and we push for accountability. Do not suggest or imply that Prichard residents caused this situation. The failure lies with multiple layers of government leadership who did not protect the community.","Potential racist comments blaming community – redirect to systemic issues. Industry may argue funding is unavailable – counter with State Revolving Fund (SRF) program facts.",""
