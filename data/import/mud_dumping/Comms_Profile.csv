mud-dumping,corear@mobilebaykeeper.org,,true,"Yes - if it includes numbers or stats.","Mobile Bay is a gem of our state. It is rich with life, and once had even more riches. Our coastal communities were founded upon a reliance on our waters, and these waters are a part of the fabric of our economies and cultures.

The commercial oyster and fishing communities have come out strongly in defiance of federal mud dumping. Their message has remained consistent and strong throughout the entirety of the campaign. 

Recreational sportsmen have also decried the practice. The aerial footage of dredging operations near Middle Bay Light galvanized the movement. 

Most of the local citizens engaged with the issue want an end to in-Bay disposal. They understand that its a historical abberation and that funds can be made available for offshore disposal.","There is a potential that some electeds may call for more time … more time for studies, more time for legislative negotiation. These calls for further negotiation may even come from electeds who’d previously espoused support for a ban on mud dumping.","With the shutdown happening on October 1, it looks the effort to get funds appropriated for the offshore disposal of dredge funds is dead in the water. 

Now the effort turns to WRDA, and putting pressure on legislators to get the language enacted in the 2026 bill. The timeline on this could vary. 

There is the risk of Sens. Britt and Tuberville withdrawing support, or having support wane, for WRDA, especially in light of Congressional dysfunction. 

Another risk is the prospect of losing the momentum of community engagement as the WRDA process drags on.","PR & Media Strategy:
*The priority now shifts to putting community pressure on federal electeds to secure language in WRDA 2026 banning in-Bay disposal, as well as the introduction of state legislation to achieve the same measure. 
*In the event ESA litigation is filed in the coming months, the tenor and frequency of mud-dumping communications could shift. 
*Enlist media coverage of the campaign to get in-Bay disposal language enacted in WRDA 2026.
*Continue with Action Alert, phone-calls, and letter-writing campaigns to federal electeds. 
*Consider getting state electeds to author op-eds calling for mud-dumping ban in WRDA. 
*Focus on pressuring electeds to enact language in WRDA 2026 that bans federal mud-dumping. 
*Continue to harness the community outrage and concern engendered by the prolonging of federal mud dumping. 
*Tailor media outreach to vicissitudes of campaign, making sure to best leverage those relationships when the timing is right. 
*Time promotion of Action Alerts directed at Britt, Tuberville, et. al. with guidance from Luke on where the reps stand at the moment. 
*Enlist grasstops through Point Clear Property Owners.
*Potentially discuss recycling possibilites of dredge-spoil, including harbor rock, an interest of Port interim director Doug Otto.

Timeline Notes:
Future timeline TK. With the shutdown in place, the timing of WRDA milestones appears to be up in the air. There is also the possibility of litigation through the ESA act which could impact the timing of all communications.
